<h1>Travel and Adventures</h1>
<p>Traveling and having adventures is an important measurement of success and hapiness in my life.</p>
<p>While I thoroughly enjoy staying at home and being productive, I also enjoy going to new places and meeting new people.</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions in the travel and adventures area.</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>How many cities did I visit?</li>
  <li>How many countries did I visit?</li>
  <li>How many check-ins did I make?</li>
  <li>What places were my top check-ins?</li>
  <li>What public transit did I use?</li>
  <li>How many miles did I travel?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Foursquare</li>
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>Instagram</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to automatically pull checkins from Foursquare and Facebook, as well as lat / long from pictures updloaded via Instagram.</p>
<p>I haven't been reliably applying geo to tweets, so only Foursquare checkins and Instagram photos had geo info.</p>
<p>I was able to answer #1,2,3,4.  I'm still working on API solutions for 5 & 6.</p>
