<h1>Storytelling</h1>
<p>Storytelling is important to me.  I feel that crafting and telling stories in the API space is important to the space, and I want to do my part.</p>
<p>There are several key ways that I tell stories in the space, thus several areas to track and and ask questions in.</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p>Since my blogs run on my own proprietary blog platform, I can easily pull the number of blog posts I wrote directly from the database. It would be nice to have an API or single place to query and get this information.</p>
<p>With public speaking, there is usually some profile and bio page availabile.  And I guess I could use Lanyrd for this?</p>
<p>To pull page views and unique visitors from my blog(s) I can use Google Analytics, so I just need to write a script to do that from my accounts.</p>
<p>Overall, much of this is still manual.  I will have to work on automation.</p>
