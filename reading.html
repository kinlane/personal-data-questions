<h1>Reading</h1>
<p>What I read on a daily basis dramatically influences my storytelling. With this in mind, tracking on how much I read and curate across my network is important.</p>
<p>My reading and curating networks are pretty refined and localized to a couple locations.
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How many blog posts did I read?</li>
  <li>How many blog posts did I curate?</li>
</ul>  
<p><strong>Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Reader</li>
  <li>Pinboard</li>
</ul> 
<p>The number of posts I scanned and read is available manually within Google Reader.</p>
<p>Everything I curate is run through pinboard.  If I favorite in Twitter or Google Reader it goes to Pinboard.</p>
<p>I use a pinboard bookmarklet to curate things I find manually.  So everything curated runs through Pinboard.</p>
